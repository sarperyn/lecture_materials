# Lecture materials

I used these slides at my lectures during the study groups and bootcamps at [inzva](https://inzva.com). inzva is a tech community dedicated to artificial intelligence and algorithms based in Istanbul, supported by an education foundation. 
Until now I have two slides. Both are contain same topics. New is always better but you can check the old one as well.
